This project uses machine learning to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and more. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (Random Forest Classifier), evaluation using accuracy and a confusion matrix, and visualization using Matplotlib.
