# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The model is trained using features such as age, gender, class, fare, and others. It leverages a Random Forest Classifier to build the prediction model and evaluates its performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib

## Files:
- `titanic_model.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `titanic.csv` – Dataset used for training the model.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `titanic_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to view the results.
